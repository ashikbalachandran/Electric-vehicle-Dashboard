In this project we working with Electrical Vehicle data.The dashboard gives the idea of overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth. Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs. Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset. Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models. Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset. Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
